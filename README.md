I'm currently pursuing a professional certificate in Data Analytics from Southern Methodist University as a part of their 2023 Data Analytics boot camp! I have a BM in music composition, as well as a minor in arts administration from Texas Christian University. I've often said that music is my life, and that remains true in many ways. However, I've also found that observing and analyzing data is an incredibly strong passion of mine as well.

Many I know have asked how those two seemingly unrelated topics coexist and my response would be...that it all depends on your approach. **For example** I consider myself a very analytical thinker. In composition, this means I typically write my music line-by-line, step-by-step in a progressive way that feels logicial to me. I'd prefer to write for one instrument at a time rather than from a holistic standpoint, or measure-by-measure per many instruments. My melodic/harmonic ideas usually build upon one another rather than coming to me all at once!

Conceptually, this flows over in my approach to gathering/analyzing data as well - which is why I think I enjoy it so much! Of course, it's important to take in everything that's in front of you when gathering information for your projects. However, when developing code, manipulating dataframes, creating a database, performing an exploritory analysis, etc., it's **absolutely** vital to consider the specifics of what is being utilized FROM said "big picture". If one were to try and develop too many lines of code at once without first defining variables or creating a function(s), the code would break.

I'm proficient in Python, as well as having experience in HTML, SQL, and VBA. I also utilize Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook well. Other passions in my life include my landscape and abstract photography you can check out [here](https://www.instagram.com/the_anal0g_k1d), as well as dabbling in the [streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/chippimunkoo) and [video editing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrrHsooO6xuR6tYtcSym-Sw) worlds, too! :)
