<div style="text-align: center;">

My name is Jonathan Carmichael. I'm currently pursuing a certificate in Data Analytics from SMU as a part of their 2023 Data Analytics boot camp! I have a BM in music composition, as well as a minor in arts administration from TCU. Music (particularly composing) is my life, but observing/analyzing data is a strong passion. I'm proficient in Python, as well as having experience in SQL, VBA, and can utilize VS and JN well. Other passions in my life include my landscape and abstract photography you can check out [here](https://www.instagram.com/the_anal0g_k1d), as well as dabbling in the [streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/chippimunkoo) and [video editing](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrrHsooO6xuR6tYtcSym-Sw) worlds, too!
